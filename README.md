# noisecalculator

This Noise calculator is developed by Equinor and available as a planning tool for whoever would like to use it.


The Noise calculator calculates noise exposure and accepted working duration in noisy areas and/or noisy work operations


The Noise calculator is based on documented risk assessments for the relevant noisy work operations and is applicable to both 8 and 12 hour working days.


It is possible to take a printout of the evaluation in pdf format, for planning of jobs, as documentation of exposure after work has been carried out, and as documentation in case of a developing work related illness


When using noisy equipment also involves exposure to vibration: When evaluating permitted working hours, when there is simultaneous exposure to noise and vibration, the exposure allowing the shortest working hours is determinative. See more details in ”Information”.
