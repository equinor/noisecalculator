                This page builds a sign in message that is sent to the Local STS using WS-Federation
                that will return the user to the page they originally requested after authentication
                is successful. For a more complete explanation of how the sample works, please refer 
                to the readme.html file in the VS solution or to the sample’s <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Claims-Aware-MVC-523e079b">online description</a>.
